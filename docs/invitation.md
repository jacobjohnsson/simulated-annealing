Hello you!

Are you interested in boosting your skills and productivity? David Svensson
Fors and me are happy to invite you to our upcoming workshop on perf: Linux
profiling with performance counters.

Why attend?
Understanding our applications' runtime behavior is an important debugging tool.
This workshop is designed for all curious minds, regardless of prior knowledge
and experience.

In this workshop you'll get hands on experience with profiling real-world
applications, fixing the issues and verifying your improvements. We will
present the perf tool and then let you loose on two interesting problems which
you will solve by yourself or with a colleague. When you are happy with your
solutions we will discuss your findings.

Reserve your spot!
Or don't, spaces are unlimited. Actually, tell your friends. They shouldn't
miss this opportunity, it may not come again.

Still, please respond to this invite so we know how many will attend.

Looking forward to seeing you there!
