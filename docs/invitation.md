Hello you!

Are you interested in boosting your skills and productivity? David Svensson
Fors and me are happy to invite you to our workshop on perf: Linux profiling
with performance counters.

Why attend?
Understanding our applications' runtime behavior is an important debugging
tool. This workshop is designed for all curious minds, regardless of prior
knowledge and experience. You'll get hands on experience with profiling
real-world applications, fixing the issues and verifying your improvements. We
will present the perf tool and then let you loose on two interesting problems
which you will solve by yourself or with a colleague. When you are happy with
your solutions we will discuss your findings.

Reserve your spot!
Or don't, spaces are unlimited since it will be online over Teams. Actually,
tell your friends! They shouldn't miss this opportunity, it may not come again.
Still, please respond to this invite so we know how many will attend.

Practicalities
- We strongly recommend pairing up with a colleague, in advance if possible.
- You need to install perf on your or your colleagues machine.
- The workshop will be held in Teams.

Looking forward to seeing you there!
